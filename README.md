# crypto-market-bot
Just playing around with some ideas about gaining crypto exchange arbitrage opportunities :p


For now I am just collecting data and checking how profitable is to build arbitrage bot, so I am just validating idea. This program is getting data from bitfinex's API and analysing how profitable it would be to do a inter-exchange arbitrage. It's storing all data at the server. Code is running a Codeanywhere's server. You can access up to date JSON file at
